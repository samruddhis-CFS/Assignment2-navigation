Assignment-2 React-native Navigation

This project is a basic Instagram clone built using React Native with TypeScript, following the assignment requirement to implement a multi-screen app with Stack, Tab, and Drawer navigation.

Navigation Used:
Stack Navigator – For handling screen-to-screen transitions.

Bottom Tab Navigator – To switch between main sections like Home, Search, Reels, Notifications, and Profile.


Screens Created and Their Functionalities:
Screen	Type	Functionality
Home	Tab	Displays placeholder content (real feed logic can be added later).
Search	Tab	Placeholder for future search implementation.
Reels	Tab	- UI not yet implemented – placeholder tab only.
Notifications	Tab	Displays dummy notifications (can be expanded).
Profile	Tab	Displays user profile with avatar, stats, bio, highlights, and post grid.

Assignment Goal Summary:
The main objective was to demonstrate multi-screen navigation using navigation:

Main navigation handled via Tabs.

Deep screen flow handled by Stack.
